More information equals a better prediction of the future.</p><p>Consider, though, the (historical) idea of divine omniscience, where the future is already known---but not to us. How might predictive state surveillance look differently in light of the history of religion?</p><p>A 2017 report on surveillance and social justice by the <a href="http://www.srtp.org.uk/assets/uploads/Surveillance_and_Social_Justice_FINAL.pdf">Church of Scotland</a> (with input from Eric Stoddart) says &#x201C;God does not gather information about us.&#x201D; God is, however, omniscient.</p><p>One consequence of God&#x2019;s omniscience is Predestination. He knows everything, so he knows each person&#x2019;s fate: to heaven or to hell. It is the ultimate instance of knowledge from above determining an individual&#x2019;s future. Predestination has an important place in the dominant ideology of one of the earliest cultures of modern state surveillance: 16th century, Elizabethan England.</p><p>With the rise of predictive policing and data analysis practices that seem to constrain and call into question free will, I argue that the literature of predestination can help us deal with surveillance today that aspires it seems to a kind of &#x201C;secular omniscience&#x201D; (a phrase of D. Lyon&#x2019;s).</p><ul><li>So I'll to begin with a visual motivation</li><li>Then I'll dive into some history</li><li>and finally look quickly at a case study and a text</li></ul><p>(I am a literary scholar by discipline, so my arguments are based on fine-grained reading of different kinds of texts. I&#x2019;m leaving all that out here to give an overview for this audience.)</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>Another word about Predestination: <em>Predestination is secret</em>. John Calvin calls it is &#x201C;an admirable secret of the judgement of God.&#x201D; Predestination means the real existence of secret knowledge, accessible only to God. It is totally opaque to mortals. You can see how this might be threatening to sovereign power: even the most dastardly rebel cannot be proven not be one of the elect.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="1" id="perkins" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="1600" data-y="0" data-z="0"><img src="img/chain.jpg" height="650px"></img><p>&#x201C;A &#x17F;urvey or Table declaring the order of the cau&#x17F;es of &#x17F;alvation and damnation according to Gods word,&#x201D; in William Perkins, <em>The Golden Chain</em> (London, 1592).</p><p>(Image: Folger Shakespeare Library)</p><div class="notes"><p>This is a visual aid for understanding predestination from the Protestant theologian William Perkins&#x2019; book <em>The Golden Chain</em>.</p><p>(It&#x2019;s all clear right?

The comprimise had allowed Catholics to retain their old beliefs in exchange for monetary fines and loss of privileges. Elizabeth famously made these policies &#x201C;not liking to make windows into men&#x2019;s hearts and secret thoughts.&#x201D;</p><p>Following the Northern Rebellion, calls for greater scrutiny of Catholics used the religious discourses of divine omniscience and providential future.</p><p>A sermon &#x201C;Against Rebellion&#x201D; was added to the official sermons (which were required listening). It reminded listeners that Queen Elizabeth was appointed by God, and quoted Ecclesiastes: &#x201C;Curse not the king, no not in thy thought... for the [birds] of heaven shall carry the voice.&#x201D;</p><p>But the Elizabethan government had to confront a problem in the state religion. The potentially subversive paradoxes of predestination and providence. God had doomed the rebellion, proving God was Protestant. But the future was secret: the next rebellion could succeed.</p><p>Elizabeth banned preaching about predestination.</p><p>So: How to secure the future if God has determined it?</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="9" id="herle-letter" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="-180" data-rotate-z="0" data-x="-16000" data-y="2000" data-z="0"><img src="img/herle.jpg" height="600px"></img><p>Letter by William Herle, 1571.</p><p>(Image: Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, University College London.)</p><div class="notes"><p>In 1571 an informant, spy, and sometime diplomat named William Herle wrote to Queen Elizabeth with an entrepreneurial proposal.</p><p>The presence of foreigners and the international political situation (with Spain and the Netherlands, France) writes Herle, is dangerous: &#x201C;presaigeng som mete fere to be had.&#x201D; A lack of centralized information about foreigners and possible &#x201C;underminers&#x201D; leaves &#x201C;the cheeff mistery unknowen.&#x201D;</p><p>He wanted to be put in charge of a &#x201C;survey of strangers.&#x201D; This is among the earliest known usages of the term &#x201C;survey&#x201D; in English to mean large-scale government information gathering on individuals for security&#x2014;&#x201C;surveillance&#x201D; in the modern sense.</p><p>Herle uses the language of loving fear of the Sovereign, of God, and of the future.

The Book of Life is a persistent metaphor for predestination in biblical and religious literature. God&#x2019;s book contains the names of those predestined to eternal life. But crucially the Book of Life is UNREADABLE. So Herle suggests that the state approximate this unreachable omniscience, not to change the future, but to better serve God&#x2019;s plan.</p><p>The technical means of making <em>exact books of every part of the realm</em> have only increased since the 16th century. Losing an understanding of the theologically concepts in the history of surveillance (omniscience, predestination, providence, free will, and grace), has not (I don&#x2019;t think) helped us keep up. Instead our strange idea that we have control over our futures has allowed structures of power to dream secretly of functional omniscience, unmoored from a vision of and faith in a more just future.</p></div></div></div><div id="hovercraft-help"><table><tr><th>Space</th><td>Forward</td></tr><tr><th>Right, Down, Page Down</th><td>Next slide</td></tr><tr><th>Left, Up, Page Up</th><td>Previous slide</td></tr><tr><th>G</th><td>Go to slide number</td></tr><tr><th>P</th><td>Open presenter console</td></tr><tr><th>H</th><td>Toggle this help</td></tr></table></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/impress.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/impressConsole.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/hovercraft.js"></script></body></html>
