More information equals a better prediction of the future.</p><p>Consider, though, the (historical) idea of divine omniscience, where the future is already known---but not to us. How might predictive state surveillance look differently with theology and in light of the history of religion? A 2017 report on surveillance by <a href="http://www.srtp.org.uk/assets/uploads/Surveillance_and_Social_Justice_FINAL.pdf">Church of Scotland</a> (with input from Eric Stoddart) says &#x201C;God does not gather information about us.&#x201D;</p><p>God is, however, omniscient. One consequence of God&#x2019;s omniscience is Predestination. He knows everything, so he knows each person&#x2019;s fate: to heaven or to hell. It is the ultimate instance of knowledge from above determining an individual&#x2019;s future. Because for God, to know and to do are the same thing. Predestination has an important place in the dominant ideology of one of the earliest cultures of modern state surveillance: 16th century, Elizabethan England.</p><p>With the rise of predictive policing and data analysis practices that seem to constrain and call into question free will, I argue that the literature of predestination the working of surveillance today that aspires almost to &#x201C;secular omniscience&#x201D; (a phrase of D. Lyon&#x2019;s).</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll do in this presentation:</p><ul><li>I'll to begin with a visual example as a motivation.</li><li>Then I'll dive into the history.</li><li>I'll look at a case study and a text.</li></ul><p>------------------------------</p><p>Another word about Predestination: <em>Predestination is secret</em>. John Calvin calls it is &#x201C;an admirable secret of the judgement of God.&#x201D; Predestination means the real existence of secret knowledge, accessible only to God. It is totally opaque to mortals. You can see how this might be threatening to sovereign power: even the most dastardly rebel cannot be proven not be one of the elect.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll start with a visual example.

The state religion on which the Elizabethan regime rested had to confront the potentially subversive paradoxes of predestination and providence. God had doomed the rebellion; God was Protestant. But the future was secret: the next rebellion could succeed.</p><p>Official sermons (which were required listening) now included a sermon against rebellion, reminding listeners that Queen Elizabeth was appointed by God, and quotes Ecclesiastes: &#x201C;Curse not the king, no not in thy thought... for the [birds] of the heaven shall carry the voice.&#x201D;</p><p>Elizabeth forbid preaching about predestination.</p><p>How to secure the future if God has determined it?</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="9" id="herle-letter" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="-180" data-rotate-z="0" data-x="-16000" data-y="2000" data-z="0"><img src="img/herle.jpg" height="600px"></img><p>Letter by William Herle, 1571.</p><p>(Image: Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, University College London.)</p><div class="notes"><p>In 1571 a little-known spy and sometime diplomat named William Herle wrote to Queen Elizabeth with an entrepreneurial proposal.</p><p>The presence of foreigners and the international political situation (with Spain and the Netherlands, France) writes Herle, is dangerous: &#x201C;presaigeng som mete fere to be had.&#x201D; A lack of centralized information about foreigners and possible &#x201C;underminers&#x201D; leaves &#x201C;the cheeff mistery unknowen.&#x201D;</p><p>He wanted to be put in charge of a &#x201C;survey of strangers.&#x201D; This is among the earliest known usages of the term &#x201C;survey&#x201D; in English to mean large-scale government information gathering on individuals for security&#x2014;&#x201C;surveillance&#x201D; in the modern sense.</p><p>Herle&#x2019;s language is not technically theological (nor would it be), but its underlying logic assumes a providential future to be known beforehand (presaged) and charged secrets (mystery) to be found out by a &#x201C;survey.&#x201D; It is the language of faithful, loving fear of the future.
