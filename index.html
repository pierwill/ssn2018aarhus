More information equals a better prediction of the future.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.srtp.org.uk/assets/uploads/Surveillance_and_Social_Justice_FINAL.pdf">Church of Scotland</a> has recently written, &#x201C;God does not gather information about us.&#x201D; God is, however, omniscient. So: what if we take seriously the (historical) idea of omniscience, where the future is already known---but not to us. How might predictive state surveillance look differently seen theologically, in light of the history of religion?</p><p>One particular theological struggle---Predestination---has an important place in the dominant ideology of one of the earliest cultures of modern state surveillance: Elizabethan England.</p><p>Predestination is a consequence of God&#x2019;s omniscience. He knows everything, so he knows each person&#x2019;s fate: to heaven or to hell. It is the ultimate instance of knowledge from above determining an individual&#x2019;s future. Because for God, to know and to do are the same thing.</p><p>With the rise of predictive policing and data analysis practices that seem to constrain and call into question free will, I argue that the literature of a &#x2014;predestination&#x2014;uncovers otherwise hidden depths in the histories of surveillance.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll do in this presentation:</p><ul><li>I'll to begin with a visual example as a motivation.</li><li>Then I'll dive into the history.</li><li>I'll look at a case study and a text.</li></ul><p>------------------------------</p><p>If I only tell you one thing about Predestination for what follows it&#x2019;s this: <em>Predestination is secret</em>. John Calvin calls it is &#x201C;an admirable secret of the judgement of God.&#x201D;</p><p>He wrote that Predestination implies the existence of information that could infallibly predict a persons future. That information is secret and accessible only to God. It is totally opaque to mortals. But there has to be some sort of process. Inquiring into it was like pressing into God&#x2019;s secret closet [room].</p><p>In addition: An important metaphor to remember: Book of Life.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll start with a visual example.

After the Northern Rebellion predestination and providential futurity were deployed as intellectual weapons.</p><p>Following the Northern Rebellion of 1569, calls for greater scrutiny of Catholics used religious discourses of divine omniscience and providential future.
