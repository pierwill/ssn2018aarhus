.. title: Predestination and Prediction: Reformation theology and
   state surveillance

.. abstract: With the rise of predictive policing and data analysis
   practices that seem to constrain and call into question free will,
   this paper argues that the literature of a particular theological
   struggle—predestination—uncovers otherwise hidden depths in the
   histories of surveillance. With gestures toward post–9/11
   surveillance, this paper argues that predestination underlies the
   creation of one of the earliest cultures of modern state
   surveillance: Elizabethan England. Following the Northern Rebellion
   of 1569, calls for greater scrutiny of Catholics used religious
   discourses of divine omniscience of predetermined futures
   characteristic of the period. But the state religion on which the
   Elizabethan regime rested had to confront the potentially
   subversive paradoxes of predestination. Proceeding from how
   Calvin’s theology of predestination creates new kinds of secret
   subjects, I turn to texts that called for surveillance following
   the 1569 rebellion. By examining the pre-secular Reformation
   period, this paper argues that a religious genealogy of early
   modern surveillance points to the ways twenty-first century
   surveillance dreams of control through prediction.

   In her book *Carceral Capitalism*, Jackie Wang writes that in our racialized security states, “uncertainty is presented as an information problem.” Inherited from both finance capitalism and techno-scientific research, “big data” surveillance oftens aims to mitigate risk from an unknown future. More information equals a better prediction of the future.

   The `Church of Scotland`_ has recently written, “God does not gather information about us.” God is, however, omniscient. So: what if we take seriously the (historical) idea of omniscience, where the future is already known---but not to us. How might predictive state surveillance look differently seen theologically, in light of the history of religion?

   One particular theological struggle---Predestination---has an important place in the dominant ideology of one of the earliest cultures of modern state surveillance: Elizabethan England.

   Predestination is a consequence of God’s omniscience. He knows everything, so he knows each person’s fate: to heaven or to hell. It is the ultimate instance of knowledge from above determining an individual’s future. Because for God, to know and to do are the same thing.

   With the rise of predictive policing and data analysis practices that seem to constrain and call into question free will, I argue that the literature of a —predestination—uncovers otherwise hidden depths in the histories of surveillance.

   Here’s what I’ll do in this presentation:

   - I'll to begin with a visual example as a motivation.
   - Then I'll dive into the history.
   - I'll look at a case study and a text.

   \------------------------------\

   If I only tell you one thing about Predestination for what follows it’s this: *Predestination is secret*. John Calvin calls it is “an admirable secret of the judgement of God.”

   He wrote that Predestination implies the existence of information that could infallibly predict a persons future. That information is secret and accessible only to God. It is totally opaque to mortals. But there has to be some sort of process. Inquiring into it was like pressing into God’s secret closet [room].

   In addition: An important metaphor to remember: Book of Life.

   I’ll start with a visual example. This is the first:

   This is from the theologian Protestant William Perkins’ book *The Golden Chain*. It’s a visual aid for understanding predestination.

   Is this decision tree choice or the illusion of choice? What does it say about the internal workings of power on individuals?

   Next, let’s look at an image from a more contemporary archive:

   Together these two images suggest that predestination is a good way of thinking through these problems today.

   A godlike view of time and a individual fate from above.

   - Process or sequence?
   - What kind of structure Cause and effect?
   - COMPAS is a decision tree in prospective view, PERKINS is a decision tree in eternity.

   This example is about mass incarceration. Further on I’ll be talking more in the context of predicting the future and avoiding risk in the rise of *national security surveillance states*.

.. note::

   In 1569, a large but short-lived rebellion by two Northern nobles became first large-scale test of the Elizabethan Settlement (wherein a compromise was made allowing Catholics to retain their old beliefs in exchange for hefty fines and loss of some privileges). Elizabeth famously made these policies “not liking to make windows into men’s hearts and secret thoughts.” But after the rebellion, official sermons (which were required listening) included a new homily against rebellion (featuring the verse from Ecclesiastes that Michael told us about.) After the Northern Rebellion predestination and providential futurity were deployed as intellectual weapons.

   Following the Northern Rebellion of 1569, calls for greater scrutiny of Catholics used religious discourses of divine omniscience and providential future. The state religion on which the Elizabethan regime rested had to confront the potentially subversive paradoxes of predestination.

Letter by William Herle, 1571.

(Image: Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, University College London.)

.. note::

   In 1571 a little-known spy and sometime diplomat named William Herle wrote to Queen Elizabeth with an entrepreneurial proposal.

   The presence of foreigners and the international political situation (with Spain and the Netherlands, France) writes Herle, is dangerous: “presaigeng som mete fere to be had.” A lack of centralized information about foreigners and possible “underminers” leaves “the cheeff mistery unknowen.”

   He wanted to be put in charge of a “survey of strangers.” This is among the earliest known usages of the term “survey” in English to mean large-scale government information gathering on individuals for security—“surveillance” in the modern sense.

   Herle’s language is not technically theological (nor would it be), but its underlying logic assumes a providential future to be known beforehand (presaged) and charged secrets (mystery) to be found out by a “survey.” It is the language of faithful, loving fear of the future. Herle emphasizes Elizabeth’s care for her subjects throughout his letter; God has assured her reign, she just needs a little help to see his plan.

   Herle proposes the creation of a register of all foreigners, what their faith is, what they’re doing in England, etc. He says:

:id: herle-exacte-book

ytt asketh then (so plesing your highnes) an **exacte booke**, describeng every parte of your Reallme…… The which substancially **deciphred**, might appere from tyme to tyme, as a **certayn monument satisfieng every dowtt**… & if the remnant were throwly deciphred, it were a grett assuranc to the state. Again Religion shold be the more assured, & mani execrable sectes eschewed, which kindle men dangerowsly **bothe against God & their Soveraigne**.

- William Herle to Elizabeth I, October 1571

.. note::

   *ytt asketh then (so plesing your highnes) an exacte booke, describeng every parte of your Reallme…… The which substancially deciphred, might appere from tyme to tyme, as a certayn monument satisfieng every dowtt… & if the remnant were throwly deciphred, it were a grett assuranc to the state. Again Religion shold be the more assured, & mani execrable sectes eschewed, which kindle men dangerowsly bothe against God & their Soveraigne.*

   I think this “exact book” can be (and would have been) understood as a shadow of the Book of Life—the persistent metaphor for predestination in biblical and religious literature.

   ..
      (Maybe the Domesday Book as well, though I’m less sure about this.) Herle was a down-on-his-luck character, and his survey’s appearing “from time to time” is a canny bid for employment. More cannily, though, Herle’s program provides an answer to the challenges of Norton’s allegory. The Trojan Horse cannot be searched if it is fated to succeed. Providentia (providence) the scholastics tell us is a species of prudentia (prudence). But prudence demands that steps be taken to assuage doubt, whatever the fears; like Calvinist’s austere devotion.
