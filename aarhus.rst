.. title: Predestination and Prediction: Reformation theology and state surveillance
.. abstract: With the rise of predictive policing and data analysis
   practices that seem to constrain and call into question free will,
   this paper argues that the literature of a particular theological
   struggle—predestination—uncovers otherwise hidden depths in the
   histories of surveillance. With gestures toward post–9/11
   surveillance, this paper argues that predestination underlies the
   creation of one of the earliest cultures of modern state
   surveillance: Elizabethan England. Following the Northern Rebellion
   of 1569, calls for greater scrutiny of Catholics used religious
   discourses of divine omniscience of predetermined futures
   characteristic of the period. But the state religion on which the
   Elizabethan regime rested had to confront the potentially
   subversive paradoxes of predestination. Proceeding from how
   Calvin’s theology of predestination creates new kinds of secret
   subjects, I turn to texts that called for surveillance following
   the 1569 rebellion. By examining the pre-secular Reformation
   period, this paper argues that a religious genealogy of early
   modern surveillance points to the ways twenty-first century
   surveillance dreams of control through prediction.

   I'm going to begin with a contemporary visual example as a motivation. Then I'll dive into the history. I'll example an important document.
